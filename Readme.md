Persistent Clipboard

Saves clipboard entries for later use. Keeps the information around across 
restarts. 

- Will not save blank or duplicate (same text twice in a row) entries.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Ins` will show the form.
- Enter or Click on an item puts that item on the clipboard and hides the form.
- `Esc` will hide the form without making a selection
- `/` then type to search history for specific item
- Note: If you use it and run Visual Studio as an Administrator, you will need to run this as an admin as well.

TODO:

1. Better searching in history
2. Add context menu when clicking on with delete and clear commands.
3. NotifyIcon and splash screen
4. Allow user defined static entries.
5. Allow portable mode which stores data in a subdirectory instead of user profile.
6. Auto paste on select - how do you even do that?
